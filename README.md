# mlr
This repository contains predictive models built using the mlr package in R.
The package was used to perform data exploration and imputation, feature engineering and machine learning. 

This example is based of this [hackathon](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/). To download the datasets sign up for the competition. 

Algorithms used in this repository: 

* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest 
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
* Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)
