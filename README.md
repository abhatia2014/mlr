# mlr
This repository contains examples of predictive models built using the mlr package in R.

This example is based of this [hackathon](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/).

Algorithms used in this repository: 

* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
* Logistic Regression
* Decsision Tree
* Random Forest 
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
* Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)
